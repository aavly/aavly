- 👋 Hi, I’m @aavly  
- 🎓 I'm a student at [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/), diving deep into the world of software engineering.  
- 👀 I’m passionate about **Full Stack Development** and **UX Design** — especially when it’s used to build thoughtful, inclusive communities and improve everyday life through tech.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Node.js**, **React**, and exploring the magic behind **user-centered design**.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects, portfolio pieces, or anything that mixes design and code!  
- 📫 You can reach me at: [annavyly@gmail.com] or connect with me on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/anna-ly-410800241)  
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I used to deadlift 100kg in my prime 💪 but I have since shifted to hypertrophy training and no longer kill my back (intentionally)
